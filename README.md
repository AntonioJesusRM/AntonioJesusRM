<h2 align="center">About me</h2>

<p>
I am a junior developer who has successfully completed a mobile programming bootcamp and the prestigious 42 course. Since starting my higher education in programming, I have worked on various personal projects and continued my education, driven by my passion for technology.

I have demonstrated strong skills in effort and learning, resilience to frustration, and problem-solving abilities throughout my professional experience. I am looking for a project where I can apply my knowledge as a mobile app developer and continue growing in a company that shares my values.
